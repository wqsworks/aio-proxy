# aio-proxy

## 0.16.0

### Minor Changes

- [#249](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/pull/249) [`e5e18af`](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/commit/e5e18af5f48f54c9dcc8e823fbcda137a97ad4b5) Thanks [@baranwang](https://github.com/baranwang)! - openai-chatgpt: report ChatGPT OAuth quota in the dashboard

  The ChatGPT (Codex) OAuth adapter now reads `wham/usage`, so its Provider card shows the quota ring: the 5-hour and weekly windows, any model-specific limits the account reports (Codex Spark and the like), the subscription plan, and the available rate-limit reset credits.

## 0.15.0

### Minor Changes

- [#244](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/pull/244) [`44a3b38`](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/commit/44a3b383bda177c8ee0124e53325cb8c63e1752d) Thanks [@baranwang](https://github.com/baranwang)! - cli: add `aiop` as a short command for `aio-proxy`

- [#243](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/pull/243) [`1daece3`](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/commit/1daece3dd2dad3ddfe86c12784ef379e99424c91) Thanks [@baranwang](https://github.com/baranwang)! - OAuth providers now hide models with `excludedModels` instead of a `models` whitelist. Leftover `models` keys are ignored and no longer restrict exposure — newly discovered catalog ids stay visible unless hidden. Plugin default aliases inherit at runtime and are no longer written into the config file.

## 0.14.0

### Minor Changes

- [#245](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/pull/245) [`3408993`](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/commit/340899373f0244e6dd240459d6e02d187998961f) Thanks [@olivewind](https://github.com/olivewind)! - Let AI SDK provider packages be installed from a configurable npm registry in the dashboard, and load model catalogs from packages that expose an optional `listModels` method.

## 0.13.0

### Minor Changes

- [#239](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/pull/239) [`b1f5bff`](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/commit/b1f5bff2f2e92abfd54b90fb32b29b4b145e8c1d) Thanks [@baranwang](https://github.com/baranwang)! - Redesign the dashboard Provider list as a card grid and surface OAuth remaining quota.

  Each Provider — including each OAuth account — is now one card showing its name, kind, protocols,
  plan, routing priority and weight, 24-hour success rate and p95 latency, model count, and request
  count, with search and availability/enablement/kind filters replacing the old table's pagination and
  grouping. OAuth Providers whose plugin exposes a quota capability show a remaining-quota ring that
  opens a detail dialog with one bar per quota window that reports a remaining amount.

  The quota read is cached in memory behind a per-provider five-minute cooldown, refreshed
  asynchronously once a Provider has finished answering a model request, and exposed at
  `QUERY /dashboard/api/providers/:id/quota`; the dialog's refresh button bypasses the cooldown, and the
  Providers page polls the reading the way it already polls health. `OAuthQuotaSnapshot` gains an
  optional `plan`, which `kimi-code` and `xai-grok` now populate, and `xai-grok` also reports per-product
  usage. Dashboard Provider summaries gain `protocols` and `hasQuota` in place of the single `protocol`
  field.

### Patch Changes

- [#239](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/pull/239) [`07413a1`](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/commit/07413a116385e94e20e2c722ecdb32c0b97d52b6) Thanks [@baranwang](https://github.com/baranwang)! - Restore the accessible names on the combobox clear and chip remove buttons

  A `shadcn add combobox --overwrite` had discarded the hand-applied patch, leaving both icon-only
  buttons announced as an unnamed "button" and forwarding the localized labels to the DOM as dead
  attributes. The same overwrite re-hid the chevron trigger whenever a value was set, which left a
  pointer user on a filled field with no visible control that reveals the curated list.

- [#238](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/pull/238) [`99755b5`](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/commit/99755b58b7492f9da4161ac429325dd319ba48f8) Thanks [@baranwang](https://github.com/baranwang)! - core: preserve stable session affinity across supported language protocols and native Gemini Interactions continuations.

- [#242](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/pull/242) [`672e0db`](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/commit/672e0dbb4eb0d81b965164b05d7a83dc9db23cda) Thanks [@baranwang](https://github.com/baranwang)! - Replace the Dashboard `cn` helper's `clsx` and `tailwind-merge` implementation with the `cn` package.

- [#241](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/pull/241) [`1299208`](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/commit/129920850794518d0089762bb015eeac12e4de71) Thanks [@baranwang](https://github.com/baranwang)! - Fix Dashboard OAuth authorization windows. Device-code providers now navigate the window opened on the
  authorize click instead of leaving a blank tab that only loaded after switching back to the dashboard,
  and the authorization panel no longer opens a second window on top of it — providers that authorize by
  URL, such as Cursor, opened two authorization pages.

## 0.12.3

### Patch Changes

- [#235](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/pull/235) [`aeec254`](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/commit/aeec254e53904ecf656d055ea9f45029f5bb68a8) Thanks [@baranwang](https://github.com/baranwang)! - Group dashboard model cost and usage by the requested model alias instead of the upstream model a route resolved to.

- [#237](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/pull/237) [`e735323`](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/commit/e7353232a59b83235f88948a72f94fa5e6219e87) Thanks [@baranwang](https://github.com/baranwang)! - Route image generation for models whose image output is only declared by models.dev. A provider that lists an image model in `models` (or reaches it through an alias) no longer needs a hand-written `router.models` metadata entry to avoid a 501 `not_implemented`.

- [#237](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/pull/237) [`c8dd136`](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/commit/c8dd1369bc9b08570bb74c77befca449272abfb0) Thanks [@baranwang](https://github.com/baranwang)! - Stop an unbounded snapshot-rebuild loop when the models.dev catalog cache expires. The cold-catalog warm now refreshes the provider catalog the staleness check actually reads, instead of a per-model cache that could already be warm — which previously left the check false forever and requeued a rebuild on every pass.

## 0.12.2

### Patch Changes

- [#233](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/pull/233) [`ccf42a4`](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/commit/ccf42a4555539dd311a0cc36eefd41e75afdd9ac) Thanks [@baranwang](https://github.com/baranwang)! - Emit completed output-item events for streamed OpenAI Responses reasoning and assistant messages so clients can finalize cross-protocol responses.

## 0.12.1

### Patch Changes

- [#230](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/pull/230) [`e674d9a`](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/commit/e674d9a225d36d03fb388c223a6559beff6adb4d) Thanks [@baranwang](https://github.com/baranwang)! - oauth: show normalized account emails for connected OAuth providers

- [#231](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/pull/231) [`70756e3`](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/commit/70756e3fe1bd63be4871bd2dc9901b159db47de6) Thanks [@baranwang](https://github.com/baranwang)! - dashboard: grade traces latency like new-api and show the lightning icon for fast/priority requests

  Chat Completions `service_tier` now maps onto the speed routing axis (`priority`/`fast` → fast, `flex` → flex), matching Responses.

## 0.12.0

### Minor Changes

- [#226](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/pull/226) [`9c16d0b`](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/commit/9c16d0b56a954563a296e5363869d5bae12ffda2) Thanks [@baranwang](https://github.com/baranwang)! - Configure model metadata once per exposed model at `router.models.<slug>.metadata`, including `extend`, with per-Provider `cost` and `limit` overrides under `router.models.<slug>.providers.<id>`. The removed `providers.<id>.metadata` field is silently ignored, and metadata keys no longer create routes; expose models through `providers.<id>.models` or `alias`. Metadata editing now lives in the Dashboard routing drawer instead of the Provider editor.

  Rename the plugin SDK's free-form `ModelDescriptor.metadata`, `ModelCatalog.metadata`, and raw-resolver `metadata` input to `extra`, and add typed `ModelDescriptor.modelMetadata` for host-consumed model metadata. Publish `@aio-proxy/types` as the SDK metadata type source.

### Patch Changes

- [#228](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/pull/228) [`2cb5333`](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/commit/2cb5333493e582b676e34565246cfa0defb24dca) Thanks [@baranwang](https://github.com/baranwang)! - Upgrade Zod to 4.5 and compile inbound protocol request schemas with `z.compile()` (except OpenAI Responses, whose unknown-item transform logs). Upgrade es-toolkit to 1.52. Use `isPlainObject` for JSON and other plain data. Structural plugin/SDK contracts that may be class instances use `isRecord` from the published `@aio-proxy/shared` leaf package. Replace spread-Set arrays with `uniq` in packages that already depend on es-toolkit.

## 0.11.2

### Patch Changes

- [#224](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/pull/224) [`2bb3f13`](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/commit/2bb3f13f1be3707125777d080878850ef52bb865) Thanks [@baranwang](https://github.com/baranwang)! - Fix the routing share slider thumb so it follows the updated weight.

## 0.11.1

### Patch Changes

- [#220](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/pull/220) [`0635583`](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/commit/0635583d2067b41c1a27170d4330c6d7a3e53773) Thanks [@baranwang](https://github.com/baranwang)! - Preserve Codex function-tool schemas on xAI Grok OAuth requests by resolving local references and explicit object unions, while isolating only tools whose schemas cannot be converted safely.

## 0.11.0

### Minor Changes

- [#215](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/pull/215) [`4ce6cee`](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/commit/4ce6cee2412a13cc18d250af52335f456ad1db13) Thanks [@baranwang](https://github.com/baranwang)! - Add Gemini Interactions as an inbound protocol at `POST /v1beta/interactions`.

- [#212](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/pull/212) [`64718ae`](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/commit/64718aea31a3a26ef691443246163713278b5e2b) Thanks [@baranwang](https://github.com/baranwang)! - openai: add Completions and Responses compact ports

  `POST /v1/completions` and `POST /v1/responses/compact` now use the existing language-generation pipeline. Remaining official Responses resource operations return a protocol-shaped 501 instead of a generic 404. ChatGPT OAuth providers forward compact to the Codex compaction endpoint. GitHub Copilot and Kimi Code providers decline endpoints they do not serve so the same candidate can convert through its language model, or a later provider can take the request. Legacy Completions streams omit usage unless the client can opt in.

- [#213](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/pull/213) [`b6e65cd`](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/commit/b6e65cddeaab8ce356f1d5f7c0f0f7e98a401608) Thanks [@baranwang](https://github.com/baranwang)! - Add OpenAI Images inbound (`POST /v1/images/generations` and `POST /v1/images/edits`) with same-protocol raw passthrough and `imageModel` convert. Blank JSON `model` and multipart missing/empty/whitespace `model` look up `gpt-image-2` (CPA-compatible); multipart literal `null` is the explicit id `"null"`. Raw/convert use the resolved candidate id. Alias-only API providers seed every alias target so language/image inbound can route. Image-capable API and ai-sdk providers attach convert (`provider.image`) when a V4 `imageModel` can be built; primary `openai-image` stays raw+image with no language transport. Edits accept official-max JSON (`357_564_416`) and multipart (`851_048_559`) envelopes — `Bun.serve` `maxRequestBodySize` matches the multipart encoded limit so those bodies reach the adapter. Convert egress `usage` is official Images snake_case (`input_tokens`, `output_tokens`, `total_tokens`, `input_tokens_details`). Convert copies present image options onto both `openai` and `openaiCompatible` providerOptions so `@ai-sdk/openai-compatible` transports receive `quality`, `output_format`, and `output_compression`. Multipart edits parse is abort-aware and idle-bounded per body read so stalled or compressed uploads cannot pin the process-wide parse slots. Same-id JSON returns a byte-preserving clone. Explicit unchanged multipart raw replays from a size-capped disk spool (`0600`) so parse does not tee an official-max body in memory; compressed edits decode as a bounded stream (decoder output is drained with a 64 KiB pending cap so a highly compressible chunk cannot stall a parse slot or materialize the full expansion before the parser reads); the pipeline unlinks the spool after fallback attempts finish. Fallback candidates still see the original body, boundary, and integrity headers. Defaulted or aliased multipart still rebuilds FormData. Image-primary providers with a language extra endpoint keep finite ids chat-capable and materialize `provider.model` from that endpoint so inbound Responses/chat convert instead of 501. Catalog embedding-only ids stay out of language dispatch. Image raw resolve passes the inbound path so generation-versus-edit resolvers see `/v1/images/generations` or `/v1/images/edits`. Multipart body search only ends a part when `\r\n--<boundary>` is followed by `--` or CRLF, so in-file boundary text is not a delimiter. The initial boundary scan skips preamble text that contains `--<boundary>` without a line start and `--`/CRLF suffix, and keeps enough prefix bytes across chunk splits — including partial-boundary overlap — to validate that line position. Multipart parse counts through EOF so a MIME epilogue cannot bypass the official-max encoded limit or the 1 MiB non-file budget. Rewritten Images raw (defaulted/aliased JSON or any multipart rebuild) drops `Content-MD5`, `Digest`, and `Content-Digest` so upstreams do not verify the client's original body. Convert returns `501 unsupported_feature` for `image_url` or `file_id`, and enforces official mask size/format/alpha on uploaded bytes.

- [#214](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/pull/214) [`84901fd`](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/commit/84901fd5fd54ad95418ef74bb578f5b210e30612) Thanks [@baranwang](https://github.com/baranwang)! - Add inbound OpenAI Embeddings and Gemini embed/batch embed through same-protocol raw, embedding convert, and fallback.

- [#217](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/pull/217) [`e0c9ea0`](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/commit/e0c9ea0b6c8cea6329cf2eeefc2dc4ee2675d44c) Thanks [@baranwang](https://github.com/baranwang)! - Continue OpenAI Responses model fallback across completed hosted-search history and fall back xAI Grok OAuth custom grammar declarations to ordinary function tools with reversible client wire restoration.

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- [#203](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/pull/203) [`076c67b`](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/commit/076c67ba698c4cd7a3756ef370adc7a62a530402) Thanks [@baranwang](https://github.com/baranwang)! - Add `aio-proxy provider import [path]` to copy supported CPA OAuth auth files into aio-proxy accounts. OAuth plugins can declare typed CPA credential importers through the plugin SDK, and the built-in ChatGPT, Google Antigravity, Kimi Code, and xAI Grok plugins now provide them.

- [#202](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/pull/202) [`6880a93`](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/commit/6880a93b087b81aaade64a95a6bd14fe7db4c8f1) Thanks [@baranwang](https://github.com/baranwang)! - dashboard: edit model routing in a drawer by dragging priority tiers and traffic weights

### Patch Changes

## 0.9.1

### Patch Changes

- [#199](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/pull/199) [`2e19250`](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/commit/2e192507075833219fff1bec8379f4144b383c84) Thanks [@baranwang](https://github.com/baranwang)! - Return upstream model errors before committing a streaming response when AI SDK startup emits a start event first.

- [#198](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/pull/198) [`af389a5`](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/commit/af389a50b57f123c71965cd337185cb8185629e1) Thanks [@baranwang](https://github.com/baranwang)! - Serve dashboard public files such as `/dashboard/favicon.svg` from the built assets instead of the SPA fallback.

- [#199](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/pull/199) [`fcef8e5`](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/commit/fcef8e5af578aee26df0db1b2ebb30bd6e50d3a0) Thanks [@baranwang](https://github.com/baranwang)! - Keep OpenAI Responses reasoning summaries with preceding tool calls so cross-protocol tool results remain adjacent.

- [#195](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/pull/195) [`1a1c519`](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/commit/1a1c519422c9be44a770646539803c929b5b9e43) Thanks [@baranwang](https://github.com/baranwang)! - Change the default local log retention from 14 days to 3 days.

- [#197](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/pull/197) [`c9fe40d`](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/commit/c9fe40dfb7b1ad7fbadb94f4c9ce64ced43dc294) Thanks [@baranwang](https://github.com/baranwang)! - Compile OpenAI Responses custom tools to Grok-compatible function tools for xAI OAuth providers while preserving custom tool responses for clients.

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- [#189](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/pull/189) [`87126aa`](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/commit/87126aadb95151258c8d1a4e52e0f3e854ee0e54) Thanks [@baranwang](https://github.com/baranwang)! - Generate Antigravity default aliases from live model discovery and insert newly seen logical ids on refresh.

  Skip same-wire aliases that only restate one model at every effort. When a family also has a colliding `-tiered` wire, default the alias there and send `xhigh` to it instead of hiding that id. Merge leftover `-thinking` siblings onto `when.thinking` even if the picker omitted them.

  Accept object-form `alias.variants` on read, then store only `{ when, model, preserve }` rows. Unpreserved variant targets stay hidden from the client model list.

- [#181](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/pull/181) [`b1d9481`](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/commit/b1d948127f8f289a588aa3c9fe4ae7329b8d06b9) Thanks [@baranwang](https://github.com/baranwang)! - The dashboard API connection editor can now select multiple protocols and give each one its own address. Saving writes the existing `endpoints` config instead of dropping it.

- [#187](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/pull/187) [`e770d49`](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/commit/e770d49dc76fb2036a07fc948cba243f49edcd2b) Thanks [@baranwang](https://github.com/baranwang)! - Add managed OpenCode, Pi, and oh-my-pi Agent integrations. Configure them with `aio-proxy agent configure` (floors: OpenCode 1.17.10, Pi 0.84.2, oh-my-pi 17.3.7; login with `opencode auth login --provider aio-proxy` or `/login aio-proxy`). `aio-proxy upgrade` refreshes managed adapters; reload or restart the Agent after configure or upgrade. Exact string KPI values no longer lose visible precision. The plugin SDK descriptor contract, brand, and host accepted version are restored to v1; v2 descriptors are rejected. The xAI artifact smoke gate now follows plugin API v1.

- [#181](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/pull/181) [`c5b04c1`](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/commit/c5b04c183b0a9669f518bcb18f38019e96d3a8ca) Thanks [@baranwang](https://github.com/baranwang)! - Redesign the provider editor into a single page shared by api, ai-sdk, and oauth providers: five fixed sections, a persistent exposure/validation rail, an in-place two-stage OAuth authorization flow, inline alias editing, a routing weight slider, and a visual model-metadata tab. OAuth providers gain a `models` whitelist that filters the discovered catalog (empty or absent exposes everything); ai-sdk providers with an OpenAI-shaped `options.baseURL` can list their catalog; oauth providers can run draft model tests; `models: []` no longer invalidates alias-only providers. The provider edit endpoint now returns the stored credentials so the editor can prefill them, replacing the previous redaction sentinels; `GET /dashboard/api/config` and `aio-proxy config` still mask secrets.

- [#190](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/pull/190) [`f2d1122`](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/commit/f2d1122b6a946a302902070b288c9093d091808b) Thanks [@baranwang](https://github.com/baranwang)! - Add model-level Provider priority and weighted routing, stable-session candidate ordering, routing-v2 diagnostics, and a Dashboard Routing workspace. Provider weight now controls same-priority traffic instead of fixed global order; existing configurations should follow the documented migration table.

### Patch Changes

- [#181](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/pull/181) [`f8947e7`](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/commit/f8947e78bc3ec3c7ccfa04e6c82606d7fa7989d9) Thanks [@baranwang](https://github.com/baranwang)! - Author provider aliases as inline rows in the Models section instead of through a staged drawer. Each
  alias is one row — client model ID, upstream model, delete — edited in place: the name is written as it
  is typed, and the target, the conditional targets, and the "also keep the upstream model's original ID"
  switch all read and write the stored config, so nothing is staged and nothing can go stale against it.
  A name is written on every keystroke even when it collides with another row; every colliding row is
  marked, the list shows one duplicate-name alert, and Save stays blocked until the collision is resolved.
  Adding an alias appends a row that reports its own missing name rather than opening a drawer, adding a
  conditional target starts it on the alias's own upstream model instead of the first model in the list,
  and deleting an alias no longer asks for confirmation of a change that Save has not applied yet.

- [#181](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/pull/181) [`3f0e371`](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/commit/3f0e3719028e1a506b2dffd81982c2def32d1db8) Thanks [@baranwang](https://github.com/baranwang)! - Fix the provider editor silently corrupting alias variants that match on thinking or speed, and let the
  Dashboard author those conditions instead of only effort names. Config supports two variant shapes — the
  compact `{ low: { model } }` record and the `[{ when: { thinking: true }, model }]` row list — but the
  editor read and wrote both through `Object.entries`, which turns a row list into `{ "0": row }`. Saving
  an unrelated field on such an alias rewrote `when: { thinking: true }` into `when: { effort: "0" }`, a
  condition no request can ever match, so the variant stopped routing with no error shown. Variants are now
  edited as condition rows: each row picks any combination of `effort` (presets plus free text), `thinking`
  and `speed`, and rows are listed in the order they are stored, so a row never moves while its own condition
  is being edited. Saves now persist variants as `{ when, model, preserve }` rows. Compact record input is still accepted on read and rewritten to rows. The editor also reports the conditions the server would refuse or
  could never match — a row with no condition at all, a blank effort, and two rows matching the same
  condition — before the save instead of after it.

- [#181](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/pull/181) [`6560946`](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/commit/65609463e6ede5798787c54614d716f2120e8148) Thanks [@baranwang](https://github.com/baranwang)! - Align the provider editor's conditional variant rows with the prototype. Rows
  stay in the order they are stored instead of being reordered by condition
  specificity, so a row no longer jumps up the list the moment its condition is
  made more specific. Rows keep their identity across a removal, so DOM focus and
  an open condition dropdown stay with the row they belong to rather than moving to
  whichever row shifted into that position. A blank `effort` now reports the same
  "needs at least one condition" issue as an empty condition, replacing a third
  message that told the user to leave a value unset when it already was. The
  variant target dropdown drops a stray group wrapper, and the variant copy matches
  the prototype: the preserve switch names the variant, both condition errors are
  reworded, the variant target select now says which select it is instead of
  carrying the same label as the alias-level target select next to it, and the three
  condition controls name the alias they belong to instead of repeating one generic
  label per row.

  set. A malicious page could previously rebind its own hostname to `127.0.0.1` and read every

The edit view read the
  runtime config, where `extend` has already been merged into a flat copy of the model's models.dev

  loose from the catalog it was tracking.

The derived route list that feeds `/v1/models`,
  each provider's `clientModels`, and the provider editor's exposure preview put alias names first, so a
  provider that renames one model pushed that alias above the models the user actually typed into the
  whitelist. Direct ids now come first and aliases follow, in configuration order. Which models a provider
  exposes is unchanged — only the order of the listing.

Testing a model now
  reports which model succeeded, so trying two models in a row no longer leaves an unlabelled green line that
  could refer to either, and the panel now calls what it sends a model request throughout — both the button
  and the line reporting a failure, which previously described it as a connection test even though the
  connection settings above have already been checked by that point. A failed test still says the provider can
  be saved anyway. When you sign in to a provider, the control that picks which product you are signing in to
  now asks for a sign-in method instead of an "OAuth provider", which read as if it were asking again about
  the provider you were editing.

  previously ignored. If you had hand-written a `models` key on an OAuth provider it now takes effect and
  restricts which models that provider exposes. A malformed value — an empty model id, or a bare string
  instead of a list — is reported instead of being silently dropped: that one provider is marked invalid
  and unavailable in the Dashboard while the proxy and every other provider start normally. A re-login is
  now validated the same way before its config is written: a staged `models` whitelist that is malformed is
  rejected rather than persisted, so a re-login can no longer leave a working provider with a whitelist the
  next start refuses to read.

The editor saves
  credentials and model metadata in one action; if the credential half required re-authorization, the
  login path rebuilt the provider entry from a patch that had no metadata field, so the metadata half
  of the save was silently discarded.

  aliases, or model whitelist. Every field of a provider patch is optional on the wire, but rebuilding the
  entry treated an omitted field as "clear it", so a caller that sent only the fields it owned dropped
  config the user had authored elsewhere. The surfaces that ship today do send those fields — and a CLI
  re-login sends no patch at all, so these three fields were already safe there — so this fixes the contract
  rather than a flow you can hit. The rule it now follows is the one already fixed for per-model metadata: a
  field a save does not mention keeps its stored value. `weight` is the deliberate exception, because an
  omitted key is the only way to say "no weight", and clearing the display name now removes it instead of
  storing an empty name.

Every re-login rebuilt the provider
  entry from a fixed field list that omitted `metadata`, so re-authorizing from the Dashboard or running
  `provider login` again deleted all per-model overrides — including `extend`, which is how a model
  tracks its models.dev source.

The Provider ID field no
  longer disappears while creating an OAuth provider: it stays in place, empty and disabled, saying the
  authorization flow fills it in, so the fields beside it stop sliding across the card when the kind
  changes. The identity section states up front that the ID cannot change after saving, instead of hiding
  that under the field and repeating it twice, and the kind tiles head with the bare product names.

  The API Key field described itself by edit mode, so editing a provider that has no stored key still
  promised to "keep the stored key", and a create seeded from an existing entry claimed the field was
  empty when it was not. It now describes whether a key is actually stored, and says so with the copy the
  rest of the form uses: a key is optional for most upstreams, required for Anthropic's Bearer
  authentication.

  The protocol dropdown opens on OpenAI Compatible, which is what most third-party gateways speak, rather
  than on whichever protocol happened to be declared first. The AI SDK package field's placeholder is an
  example again — it used to be the bundled package name verbatim, so a cleared field looked like it was
  already filled with it, and saving that emptiness failed validation instead.

  Editing an OAuth provider now confirms the account it is connected to, announced to screen readers, in
  place of a read-only table that printed the account name a second time and said nothing about being
  connected. Its reauthorize button sits beside the copy that explains it, at the same size as the
  authorize button on the create screen.

  The Connection section no longer reports a blank API Key as a missing one. A provider that needs no key
  is a legitimate configuration, so the section's summary shows its address in every mode rather than
  "Missing API Key" while creating. Saving was never gated on the key.

- [#181](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/pull/181) [`35dacf3`](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/commit/35dacf3cfbd006598e0f1f7a4082f1f2399971c6) Thanks [@baranwang](https://github.com/baranwang)! - Stop the provider editor offering a save it will reject, and rebuild its footer and section strip to
  match the rest of the page. Only sections in a `todo` state gated the save, so a provider whose OAuth
  account was never authorized — or whose weight tied with another provider — showed a green summary, an
  enabled Save, and then failed. Every section that is not `ok` now gates it, and the three conditions
  that are advisory rather than blocking (a create-time blank API key, a stale model catalog, a weight
  tie) report as `ok` with their explanation intact instead of borrowing a warning state they do not
  need.

  The footer's status line is one live region again: the sentence and the section links it points at are
  a single announcement, so "still missing" arrives with the names of what is missing rather than reading
  the lead-in alone on every keystroke. Its lead-in also describes what it actually lists — a form held
  up only by an account waiting to be authorized reads as pending, not as missing a field. The links are
  real anchors to their sections now, so they can be copied and opened like any other link, and jumping
  from either the footer or the nav strip writes the section into the address bar.

  Delete leaves the editor: an irreversible action does not belong one tab stop from Save, and the
  providers table already offers it. Section anchors drop their `editor-` prefix, so a bookmarked
  `#models` is the same link the nav strip and footer produce. The nav strip's pinned background moves to
  a wrapper so it stops sliding out from under the pills when the strip is narrow enough to scroll, and
  its active pill is marked as the current item of a list rather than claiming to link to the current
  page. The editor is finally one `<form>` element, so labels, autofill and Enter behave the way the
  platform expects.

  Clicking a section in the nav strip or a link in the save footer now moves keyboard focus into that
  section, not just the viewport — previously focus stayed behind, so the next Tab continued from the
  strip or from Cancel/Save rather than from the section the user asked for. The nav strip is announced as
  the form's section list instead of claiming to be "Edit Provider" even while creating one.

  plain input plus an Add button that prepends new ids, every row has a checkbox
  and a remove control, alias targets are only the enabled models, and removing a
  whitelisted model silently drops aliases (and variants) that pointed at it. A row
  that exists only in the fetched upstream catalog is not on the whitelist, so its
  remove control is disabled and its aliases are left alone. OAuth providers get the same
  catalog button; it refreshes the saved edit-view catalog instead of calling the
  unsupported draft-catalog endpoint.

Per-model metadata is now reconciled against what was
  actually persisted, so creating a provider no longer writes an empty `{}` record for a model whose
  cost fields were cleared, while an edit that clears them still sends the explicit empty object the
  API needs to overwrite the stored one. A cost or context number whose text cannot round-trip is
  refused rather than displayed. And the manual-add box splits a comma- or newline-separated list into
  one id per row instead of committing the whole string as a single model id.

  disappear when nothing is testable instead of leaving a disabled full-width button,
  the visible "Model to test" label becomes an accessible name only, and a pending
  test keeps the same button copy with a spinner instead of swapping in a second
  string. The exposure panel title is "Model list", its empty state says which names
  will appear, and a disabled provider folds that reason into the same sentence.

- [#181](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/pull/181) [`02c0a8b`](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/commit/02c0a8bc9b53175e72e2cc432275a04f8fb934dc) Thanks [@baranwang](https://github.com/baranwang)! - Four provider-editor follow-ups. The save footer's lead-in now describes the list it introduces: it
  promises a missing field only when every listed section is empty, and reads "Pending" when one of them
  merely needs authorizing. The providers list prints a dash for a provider that has no configured
  weight rather than `0`, so a deliberate `0`, which is a real lowest-priority weight, is no longer
  indistinguishable from an unset one. Clearing a provider's display name and saving now removes the key
  instead of writing an empty `name` into the config file, matching what an OAuth provider already did. And
  a stored weight outside the old slider range can still be typed and saved as-is.

- [#181](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/pull/181) [`a3cf9b5`](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/commit/a3cf9b55e0377cd8df102acf3fd9463ff5899207) Thanks [@baranwang](https://github.com/baranwang)! - A display name that is only whitespace now clears the key on an OAuth provider instead of being written
  into the config file. The empty string was already dropped, but `"   "` survived on both the ordinary
  save path and reauthorization; the editor already treats a blank-after-trim name as absent, so the
  config kept a `name` nothing would ever render. Rejecting a staged OAuth write now throws a real
  `Error`, so the structured logs that record an error's name during config recovery and session-store
  writes report `ZodError` rather than `Error` or `object`; the rejection message and its
  `providers.<id>.<field>` issue paths are unchanged.

- [#181](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/pull/181) [`6fb3a79`](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/commit/6fb3a799f2abd3ee6f4fd11b01a7040be226257f) Thanks [@baranwang](https://github.com/baranwang)! - Fix four provider editor defects found by a re-survey against the design prototype. A malformed Base URL such
  as `api.example.com` no longer passes the Connection gate: the editor form has no validators of its own, so a
  string the mutation body's `z.url()` rejects used to show a green dot and an enabled Save, then bounce back as
  an error toast — it now marks Connection as to do, exactly as an empty Base URL does. That gate is http(s)-only,
  deliberately stricter than the mutation body's `z.url()`, which accepts any scheme: the proxy reaches an
  upstream over http(s), so a Base URL that parses as something else now blocks Save where it previously did not —
  `ftp://x.example`, and also `api.example.com:8080`, which `new URL` reads as a scheme rather than a host and
  port. The Connection badge names that case specifically, "Needs a valid http(s) address", rather than reporting
  a missing address for one that was typed. A disabled provider's
  Routing badge reads "Disabled" even when its weight ties with another provider's, instead of reporting a tie
  inside an attempt queue a disabled provider never joins. The permanent "Saved" line is gone; it never cleared
  itself, so it sat above a footer that had already gone back to listing sections to complete, duplicating the
  transient success toast the save already shows. And the OAuth authorization panel now renders above the sticky
  Save/Cancel bar rather than beneath it, so the device code, the authorization link and the manual callback
  field are no longer covered by the footer — previously, scrolling to the bottom of an OAuth authorization also
  left the footer stranded in the middle of the page.

A section
  missing a required field is red, one waiting on an authorization round trip is amber, a finished one stays
  primary — and any section that is not finished blocks Save. Hint counts also read "1 model" rather than
  "1 models", and an OAuth provider whose empty whitelist exposes its whole upstream catalog now says so
  instead of "0 models".

Clearing a field means absent, which the
  router treats as weight `1` and priority `0`. The editor shows an empty box for an absent value so it
  is distinguishable from an authored `0`.

Saving a provider from the editor used to drop its multi-protocol `endpoints` — the mutation body schema strips the field, so every save read as "the author deleted it" — and still answer 200. The list is now retained across a save, like `headers`, `metadata`, `proxy`, and `transforms` already were.

  Also in the editor: provider sections render as cards, and the identity section says up front that the ID is fixed once saved.

  show a value.

  An action used to be a bordered sub-card holding an "Action N" heading and three separately labelled
  controls, stacked. A rule with four actions therefore repeated four headings and four borders, and no two
  actions lined up. The action select and a single dotted path input now share one row per action,
  with the rule's "Then" connective on the first row and the value editor full-width beneath, so actions read
  down a column. Reorder and delete are icon buttons at the end of the row, and they are hidden entirely for a
  rule with one action, where reordering and deleting are both impossible — previously they were rendered
  disabled.

  The path input is monospace and takes the full dotted path, `request.body.temperature` or
  `request.headers.x-header-name`; the prefix picks the target and the remainder is what the field stores.

  A remove action left the value slot empty, which read as a control that had not loaded. It now says that a
  remove action needs no value.

  have a condition.

  Each rule now opens with a single row: the name is edited in place — a new rule is created named "Rule N",
  and clearing the box removes the name again, leaving "Rule N" as a hint — and reorder and delete sit beside
  it as icon buttons instead of three full-text buttons in a footer, so a rule list no longer spends a third
  of its height on chrome.

  A rule without a condition previously still rendered the full condition builder, which read as an unfinished
  condition nobody wrote. A rule now states that it runs on every request, and a switch turns the condition
  on: switching it on opens the builder with one editable condition ready to fill in, and switching it off
  removes the condition from the rule.

- [#181](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/pull/181) [`0a93cfd`](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/commit/0a93cfd509c919280fcfea53528e1a706edd36d5) Thanks [@baranwang](https://github.com/baranwang)! - Make the request-transform value editor easier to read and fill in.

  Object and array values are no longer typed into a cramped inline box: the rule shows the value as compact
  JSON and an Edit JSON button opens a full-height editor, where Apply stays disabled until what you typed is
  really a JSON object or array of the type you picked, and Cancel throws the draft away. Because a broken
  draft now stays inside that editor, it can no longer put the whole rule list into an invalid state or lock
  you out of the JSON tab while you fix it.

  Boolean values are chosen from a true/false select instead of a checkbox labelled "True", so setting a field
  to false is a direct choice rather than an unticked box.

  The value type and the value itself now sit side by side on one row instead of stacking as two labelled rows,
  which makes rules with several actions much shorter.

  The controls are also named for what they do rather than how they work: the mode reads Fixed value, its input
  reads Value to set, and the type select reads Value type.

The attempt-order
  preview is gone, as is the provider-level enabled switch; a provider is enabled or disabled from the

  of `0`, matching the router defaults.

Nested expression arguments all rendered the
  same accessible name — an outer and an inner argument were both just "Field" — leaving screen reader users
  with no way to tell which control they were on. Each argument control is now named by its argument path
  ("Argument 1 → Field", "Argument 2 → Argument 1 → Field"), following the path the expression editor already
  tracks internally.

  whose plugin ships default aliases. Clicking it merges the plugin's suggestions into the alias list you
  are editing: a suggestion overwrites the alias that already carries its name, every other alias you wrote
  is kept, and names the draft does not have yet are appended. Nothing is written until you save, so the
  merge can be reviewed and undone like any other edit in the form.

  Only suggestions this provider can actually route are offered: a suggestion pointing at a model outside
  the provider's enabled models is dropped, together with any of its variants, because an alias aimed at a
  model the provider does not expose is what blocks Save. The button is absent when the provider's plugin
  has no suggestions or none survive that filter, and disabled while no upstream model is enabled. A plugin
  that returns a malformed suggestion, or throws while producing them, now costs only the suggestions — the
  editor page still opens.

  computed values show a live expression preview, the expression tree gets its
  indent, argument markers and connector lines, and condition groups and rows
  get their own cards instead of a fixed 768px block.

  Function names now read from one source (`+`, `CONCAT`, `IF NULL`) instead of
  a separate set of translations, condition rows drop the move buttons,
  `provider.*` is offered only inside computed values, and every value control
  announces the rule it belongs to. The expression tree's argument markers are
  localized too, so they no longer read as Chinese in the other four locales.

The `/v1/models` Case A passthrough now guarantees the Codex client reads a non-empty prompt: it resolves one non-empty instruction text (existing `model_messages.instructions_template`, else `base_instructions`, else the bundled template) and writes it back to `base_instructions`, also replacing a present-but-empty `instructions_template` (which the client prefers verbatim). Codex client 0.146.0 treats `base_instructions` as required and prefers `instructions_template` whenever present, so upstream rows that omit `base_instructions` (gpt-5.6-sol/terra/luna) previously failed catalog deserialization and emptied the picker.

  Providers can now declare a `metadata` map keyed by upstream model id to override client-facing model metadata (name, description, token limits, capabilities) and cost accounting. User config wins over models.dev auto-discovery. Billing uses the actual hit channel's configured `cost`, and each usage row records its `priceSource` (`config`/`models-dev`/`default`). A new `router.modelContextAggregation` (`min` default / `max`) reconciles the context window when multiple providers expose the same public model.

- [#136](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/pull/136) [`465fa49`](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/commit/465fa494bc0446e11b68b0922b29ba2c15880c37) Thanks [@baranwang](https://github.com/baranwang)! - Make `count_tokens` traces distinguish upstream counts from the local estimate

  Previously a `count_tokens` request answered by the local estimator was only
  signalled by an `x-aio-proxy-token-count-estimated: true` response header, and
  candidates that were passed over before their count capability ran (no token
  count capability, unsupported image input, or a missing provider tool) left no
  span at all. A trace answered without any upstream count was therefore
  indistinguishable from an upstream success.

  The response header is removed. The local-estimate fallback now records an
  `aio_proxy.token_count` span tagged `aio_proxy.token_count.source=local_estimate`,
  and each passed-over candidate records an `aio_proxy.token_count.candidate_skipped`
  span carrying the provider id and a skip reason (`no_capability`,
  `image_unsupported`, or `missing_tool`). The observability signal moves from the
  client response into the trace, where the whole candidate loop is now visible.

  The proxy now counts generated images and web-search invocations from served
  responses (OpenAI Responses output items and streamed AI SDK file/tool-call
  parts) and reads audio token counts from OpenAI-compatible usage. These flow
  into the configured `cost` fields (`image`, `webSearch`, `inputAudio`,
  `outputAudio`), which previously had no effect because nothing produced the
  counts. Audio tokens are treated as a subset of their input/output totals (as
  the upstream reports them) and peeled out before the text rate applies, so each
  audio token is billed once at the audio rate rather than at both rates.
  Requests without such events are unaffected.

  - `/v1/models` now reflects per-provider config metadata overrides — capabilities,
    `limit.output` (max tokens), and modalities — not just the display name and
    context window. Metadata inherited via `extend` surfaces the same way.
  - `max_input_tokens` now reports the model's maximum input tokens
    (`limit.input`) rather than the total context window, so a model whose context
    window exceeds its input limit no longer over-advertises its input capacity.
  - A flat per-request fee (`cost.request`) is now billed on a successful response
    that carries no token usage, instead of being silently dropped.
  - The generated config JSON Schema references the models.dev model-id enum for
    `metadata.extend`, so editors can autocomplete and validate the slug.

  The `@aio-proxy/i18n` package built its declarations with `tsc -b`, unlike every other referenced workspace package (which use rslib). Because `paraglide-js compile` regenerates `src/paraglide/**` on every build, fresh/concurrent builds (such as the multi-arch Docker release) could see i18n's emitted `dist` as stale relative to its regenerated sources, so `@aio-proxy/core`'s declaration generation failed the composite project-reference check with `TS6305: Output file '.../i18n/dist/index.d.ts' has not been built from source file '.../i18n/src/index.ts'`.

  i18n now compiles messages and then builds with rslib like the other packages, emitting its declarations through the same pipeline and eliminating the fragile cross-package staleness check.

  silently discards a `ReadableStream` request body when `fetch` uses a proxy, so
  `api` providers with a `proxy` configured hung until timeout on streaming
  requests (e.g. `openai-response` passthrough). `createProxyFetch` now buffers a
  streamed request body to bytes before sending it through the proxy, so the body
  survives without changing the streaming response. This lets the build toolchain
  stay on the reproducible Bun 1.3.14 release.

  Inbound reasoning-effort values are now accepted leniently and clamped to what
  each candidate upstream model actually advertises, on both the raw-passthrough
  and AI SDK model-invocation paths. This fixes a `400 ... at output_config.effort`
  error when Claude Code's ultracode mode sent effort `xhigh` to an upstream that
  only supports `low`/`medium`/`high` — the request now downgrades to the highest
  supported level instead of being rejected. Capability resolution is cache-only,
  so a cold or slow models.dev never blocks the request (it falls back to
  forwarding the client's value unchanged).

Bun 1.3.x silently discarded a `ReadableStream` request body when `fetch` used a proxy, so `api` providers with a `proxy` configured hung until timeout on streaming requests (e.g. `openai-response` passthrough). The compiled binary embeds the build-time Bun runtime, so this is delivered by pinning the build toolchain to Bun 1.4.

The service unit now records the stable PATH launcher instead of the version-pinned Cellar binary, `service restart` regenerates an already-installed unit with a freshly resolved executable (recovering units that still point at a deleted old binary), and `resolveExec` falls back to the PATH launcher when the running executable was deleted mid-upgrade. `aio-proxy upgrade` now always restarts a managed daemon after upgrading (the `--restart` flag is removed); a manually started daemon still gets a self-restart hint.

Raw passthrough resolves completion at the terminal frame across all four protocols and the AI SDK path at the finish part, without ending the client stream. Adds a configurable upstream idle timeout (300s default) that cancels a stalled upstream and errors the client stream rather than closing it cleanly. OpenAI-compatible passthrough treats [DONE] (not finish_reason) as terminal so trailing include_usage accounting is still captured; session commit stays gated on true stream EOF.

- [#109](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/pull/109) [`2fdb662`](https://github.com/aio-proxy/aio-proxy/commit/2fdb662f1449087dac370988e41793760b3c4c53) Thanks [@baranwang](https://github.com/baranwang)! - ingress: tolerate unknown `detail` values on OpenAI Responses `input_image` parts. Clients such as Codex send `detail: "original"`, which previously failed the input-item union and rejected the whole request with `400 Invalid OpenAI Responses request` before any provider routing. Unrecognized values are now coerced to `undefined` (a best-effort hint), matching how downstream code already treats `detail`.
